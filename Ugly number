An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
Example 3:

Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= n <= 231 - 1

Approach:
Divide n by 2,3,5 as long as possible,finally check if n became 1.If not return false

Code:
class Solution {
public:
    bool isUgly(int n) {
    vector<int>div={2,3,5};
    if(n<=0)return false;
    for(int i=0;i<div.size();i++){
        while(n%div[i]==0)n=n/div[i];
        
    }
        return n==1;
    }
};
